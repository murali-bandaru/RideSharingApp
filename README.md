 ðŸš– Ride Sharing App Simulation

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This Java mini-project simulates a simple ride-sharing system similar to Ola and Uber.  
The user can select a ride type ('bike' or 'car') and enter the distance to travel.  
The program calculates the fare based on the ride type:  

- Bike Ride â†’ â‚¹10 per km  
- Car Ride â†’ â‚¹20 per km  

It demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as:
- Abstraction (using an abstract `Ride` class)  
- Inheritance (`BikeRide` and `CarRide` subclasses)  
- Encapsulation (private driver and vehicle details with getters)  
- Exception Handling (custom exception for invalid ride type)
