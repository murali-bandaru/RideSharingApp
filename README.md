# RideSharingApp
This Java-based mini-project simulates a ride-sharing system similar to Ola and Uber. Users can choose a ride type (bike or car) and enter the distance to travel. The program calculates the fare based on the ride type (₹10/km for bikes and ₹20/km for cars) and displays driver details, vehicle number, distance, and total fare.
